                  High pressure cleaning and washing is normally done by high
                  pressure water jet pump to remove dirt, mud, oil, grease, paint,
                  debris, scale etc... High pressure reciprocating plunger /
                  piston pump develops high pressure due to smaller diameter
                  orifice of the nozzle, which develops high pressure whivh in
                  thru converts in to high velocity causing water jet blasting on

                  Wet Sandblasting can help protect your commercial and industrial
                  property and extend the life of your equipment by eliminating
                  corrosion, rust, mold and mildew. Wet Sandblasting is perfect
                  for building exteriors, interiors, equipment or machined
                  surfaces. On many occasions sand blasting includes professional
                  cleaning, de-painting or de-burring. Sandblasting, or water
                  blasting, can be important components of industrial cleaning
                  services, as well as a very effective method for removing
                  graffiti or "tagging" on the exterior of buildings. Wet
                  Sandblasting service can slow down aging and depreciation of
                  your commercial and industrial assets, and improve the
                  appearance of your property and equipment.

                  Power plants burning anything other than natural gas will, over
                  time, build up ash that forms slag deposits on the exterior of
                  the tubes running through the boiler. The slag can be a safety
                  hazard - the tubes expand and contract as they heat up and cool
                  down and the deposits may break off and fall, a problem that
                  arises most notably when a plant is taken off line for
                  maintenance. Dirty boiler tubes can also affect the operation of
                  a plant. Slag buildup on tubes will act as an insulation
                  protecting the tube from the heat of the boiler, requiring more
                  fuel to reach the same temperature and produce the same output
                  as a clean boiler. cleaning the slag deposits inside a boiler
                  can increase boiler efficiency from 1 percent to 4 percent.
                  "Even 2 to 3 percent in a boiler that generates 600 MW, that's
                  hundreds of thousands of dollars each day or week,They're still
                  burning the coal, but the coal fire doesn't get to the tube."
                  Clean boilers can also help reduce the emissions produced by the
                  plant because less fuel is needed to produce the same amount of
                  power
